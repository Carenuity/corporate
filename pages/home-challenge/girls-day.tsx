                    Girls&apos; Day is an annual initiative designed to give
                    girls the opportunity to explore technical, scientific, IT,
                    and engineering professions. It allows them to participate
                    in hands-on workshops and real-world experiments, interact
                    with role models and professionals in STEM careers, and gain
                    confidence in their technical abilities. Most importantly,
                    it helps them discover academic and career paths they might
                    not have previously considered, opening doors to a future in
                    fields where women are often underrepresented.
