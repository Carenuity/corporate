            This website uses Google Analytics&apos; demographic features. This
            allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age,
            gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from
            interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data.
            This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual
            person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the
            ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection

            reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website
            (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an
            automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of
            the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis
            starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the
            website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information
            (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or
            mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the
            analysis will be forwarded to Google.
